<section id="about">
  <h2>Meet Jeremy Marcus</h2>
  <p>Jeremy Marcus was born and raised in New Rochelle, New York, in a household defined by public service and strong community values. His mother is a public school teacher, his father works in public relations, and his younger sister — still in high school — keeps him grounded in what really matters.</p>
  <p>A graduate of <strong>New Rochelle High School</strong> and longtime member of <strong>Beth El Synagogue</strong>, Jeremy grew up believing that public service isn’t about slogans — it’s about results. He studied political science and economics at <strong>Binghamton University</strong>, where he led civic initiatives and fought for progressive, practical reforms.</p>
  <p>Jeremy interned for <strong>New York State Senator Lea Webb</strong> in Binghamton, helping push forward legislation on healthcare, education, and climate justice. He also wrote on public policy and governance for the university’s paper, <em>BU Pipe Dream</em>, consistently promoting bold but grounded ideas to make government work better for everyone.</p>
  <p>Now, as a Democrat running for President, Jeremy is ready to bring that energy, humility, and real-world experience to the highest office in the land — to rebuild America with integrity, accountability, and action from Day One.</p>
